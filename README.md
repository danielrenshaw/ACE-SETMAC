Automatic Classification Experimenter (ACE)
===========================================

Provides facilities for running a suite of classification experiments, using cross-validation, and analysing the results.

The system is configured via a XML file, and a small amount of code is required to specify where the data is coming from and provide access to it in a specific format.


Automatic Classification Experimenter Demonstrator (ACEDemo)
============================================================

A simple demonstration of how ACE can be used to solve some classification task.

Uses Weka-based classifiers to identify spam emails.

A step-by-step guide is provided in this project (see ACEDemo/README.txt) which will help you get started with ACE. This is the recommended first reading.


Stack Exchange Topic Modelling and Classification (SETMAC)
==========================================================

A more complex use of ACE, created for a university honours project (as was ACE) to analyse the Stack Exchange data dump. The purpose the experiments were to evaluate the effectiveness (or not) of topic modelling as a support for identifying poor quality questions.
